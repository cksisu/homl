## Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow By Aurelien Geron (2nd Edition)

### Tracking repo for book exercises and other related works

I'm studying this book for a second time as part of my warmup work for my custom
"ML Masters" work. I read the book (1st edition) a few years back, but did not
really do any of the exercises and only applied bits and pieces to the work
I was doing on a day-to-day basis.

This time I want to complete the exercises to hold myself accountable and
refamiliarize myself with the the core ML libraries covered. I am developing a
Python package (mystique) that will use the libraries covered in the book and
emulate key design decisions from their Python APIs.

>I'm not the biggest fan of notebooks. They're great for presentation and

#### Exercises and practice approach

1. Read the [scikit-learn API research paper](docs/api-design-ml-software.pdf) for
   background and understanding
2. Complete the end of chapter exercises from the book with additional insight
   and commentary for posterity
3. Skip the stuff that is not of significant incremental value or is repetitive
   when compared to other work/studies I'm currently doing. *Just make sure to
   properly document why the material was skipped!*
