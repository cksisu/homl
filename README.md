# Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow

## By Aurelien Geron

### Tracking repo for book exercises and other related works

This repo is used to track my exercises and related work as I read through the
book a second time as part of my warmup work for my ML Masters work. I read the
book a few years back, but did not really do any of the exercises and only
applied bits and pieces to the work I was doing on a day-to-day basis.

This time I wanted to complete the exercises to hold myself accountable and
refamiliarize myself with the the core ML libraries covered while I develop a
Python package (mystique) that will use the packages and emulate the APIs of
the libraries covered in the book.

Reference: Link to use Author's repo and provided notebooks online:

  **Note:** I'm not the biggest fan of notebooks. They're great for presentation
  and exploration, but I prefer the more granular approach so I am completing
  the exercises using scripts and only creating notebooks and other presentation
  media where necessary or deemed more appropriate.

#### Exercises and practice approach

1. Read the [scikit-learn API research paper](api-design-ml-software.pdf) for
   background and understanding
2. Complete the end of chapter exercises from the book with additional insight
   and commentary for posterity
3. Skip the stuff that is not of significant value or is duplicative and at a
   than other work/studies I'm currently doing. *Just make sure to properly
   document why the material was skipped!*
