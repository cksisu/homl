# Chapter 2

## End-to-End Maching Learning Project

### Exercises

Using this chapter’s housing dataset:

1. Try a Support Vector Machine regressor (sklearn.svm.SVR), with various
   hyperparameters such as kernel="linear" (with various values for the C
   hyperparameter) or kernel="rbf" (with various values for the C and gamma
   hyperparameters). Don’t worry about what these hyperparameters mean for now.
   How does the best SVR predictor perform?
2. Try replacingGridSearchCVwithRandomizedSearchCV.
3. Try adding a transformer in the preparation pipeline to select only the most
   important attributes.
4. Try creating a single pipeline that does the full data preparation plus the
   final prediction.
5. Automatically explore some preparation options using GridSearchCV.
